## CYBER SECURITY ANALYST
See application for contact details.
***
### PROFESSIONAL PROFILE
I began my journey in website technologies by simply answering customer support calls for web hosting services in order to pay for film school. This is where I tripped and fell into cybersecurity. I began to focus on identifying and removing malware from websites, and fell in love with cybersecurity. This led to taking a position as a web security analyst. In this role, I improved my website development skills, gained a deeper understanding of malware and vulnerabilities, and grew professionally into a leadership role. I eventually moved into a new role protecting endpoints, which allowed me to expand my knowledge of ransomware and other malware beyond web-based or Linux attacks, into malware targeted for Windows and Mac. I have continued to grow and thrive as an industry leader, and am ready to step up to new challenges.

### CAREER EXPERIENCE
#### Threat Analyst
##### Defiant
###### Remote, U.S.
In my role as a Threat Analyst, I am responsible for utilizing available data to identify and document existing and emerging threats, including vulnerabilities, malware, and threat actors.

#### Senior Cyber Security Researcher
##### Acronis
###### Tempe, AZ
As a cybersecurity researcher, I cultivate information-sharing relationships within the cybersecurity community and utilize available resources, such as blog posts, emails, and videos, to educate the public and SMBs about current cyberthreats and best practices. The role is cross-functional, requiring strong communication and collaboration with PR, Marketing, and R&D teams internally, as well as with company Directors and C-Suite. I regularly perform deep dives into active malware and other threats, write detection rules, and perform competitive analysis and compatibility testing.

#### Manager, Web Security Research
##### SiteLock
###### Scottsdale, AZ
In my time at SiteLock, I began by identifying and removing malware from websites. I started building tools to streamline processes, and digging deeper into malware behavior and origins. This led me to to join, and eventually lead, the Research team, where I analyze malware, write clean signatures, and assist our Marketing department in communicating our findings to internal and external sources. Being a leader on the Research team has landed with me managing the team. In this role, I have trained several new analysts, and split the team into a malware definitions team, and a threat reasearch team. This has enabled us to focus on thought leadership, dig deeper into the malware and vulnerabilities we find, and work on automation and machine learning.

#### Hosting Support
##### Go Daddy
###### Gilbert, AZ
I assisted customers with issues that may arise in their shared hosting accounts, as well as working the telephone, support ticket, and server support queues as needed. In this role I continued researching malware found on customer accounts, and reviewing possible attack vectors to provide suggestions to prevent future attacks.

#### Chat Support
##### Go Daddy
###### Tempe, AZ
 I assisted customers with troubleshooting of their domain names, shared hosting accounts, email, and billing issues. I used multiple chat applications to assist customers with everything from basic account maintenance to creative problem solving as needed. Customer contacts were more account focused during this time, but I addressed technical issues as they arose. I also helped train and coach our team in India.

#### Online Support
##### Go Daddy
###### Gilbert, AZ
As an Online Support agent, I assisted customers with troubleshooting of account, domain, shared hosting, and server issues, utilizing our support ticket system. In this position, I began writing scripts to automate many of the repetitive tasks I performed, allowing my team and me to become more efficient. I found myself regularly reviewing malware infections on customer sites, and determining the best way to remediate the infection.

#### Server Administrator
##### Terra Del Sol
###### Portland, OR
At Terra Del Sol, I maintained the server and client management system. I also managed the company website, and provided desktop support as needed.
