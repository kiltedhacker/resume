See application for contact details.

### PROFESSIONAL PROFILE
I began dabbling with server administration, and website design, in high school. Nine years ago, I began working more heavily in website technology fields. I started this journey simply answering customer support calls for web hosting services, and quickly discovered my love of website design by direct coding. As I progressed in my career, I began to focus on identifying and removing malware, and eventually took a position as a security analyst at SiteLock. In my time at SiteLock, I have grown a great deal in this area, and am ready to step up to new challenges.

### CAREER EXPERIENCE
#### Cyber Security Analyst
##### Acronis
###### Tempe, AZ
In my role at Acronis, I wear a number of hats. My primary focus is on monitoring specific malware families, and writing detection rules for any new variations that are found. Another major focus for me is in building community efforts toward combatting emerging threats, whether that is new malware, malicious actors, or phishing campaigns. I am also responsible for our weekly news digest and videos, and responding to media requests in a timely fashion.

#### Manager, Web Security Research
##### SiteLock
###### Scottsdale, AZ
In my time at SiteLock, I began by identifying and removing malware from websites. I started building tools to streamline processes, and digging deeper into malware behavior and origins. This led me to to join, and eventually lead, the Research team, where I analyze malware, write clean signatures, and assist our Marketing department in communicating our findings to internal and external sources. Being a leader on the Research team has landed with me managing the team. In this role, I have trained several new analysts, and split the team into a malware definitions team, and a threat reasearch team. This has enabled us to focus on thought leadership, dig deeper into the malware and vulnerabilities we find, and work on automation and machine learning.

#### Hosting Support
##### Go Daddy
###### Gilbert, AZ
I assisted customers with issues that may arise in their shared hosting accounts, as well as working the telephone, support ticket, and server support queues as needed. In my time as a Chat Support representative, I have used multiple chat applications to assist customers with everything from basic account maintenance, to creative problem solving as needed.

#### Server Administrator
##### Terra Del Sol
###### Portland, OR
At Terra Del Sol, I maintained the server and client management system. I also managed the company website, and provided desktop support as needed.
