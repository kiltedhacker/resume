### PROFESSIONAL PROFILE
I began dabbling with server administration, and website design, in high school. Nine years ago, I began working more heavily in website technology fields. I started this journey simply answering customer support calls for web hosting services, and quickly discovered my love of website design by direct coding. As I progressed in my career, I began to focus on identifying and removing malware, and eventually took a position as a security analyst at SiteLock. In my time at SiteLock, I have grown a great deal in this area, and am ready to step up to new challenges.
